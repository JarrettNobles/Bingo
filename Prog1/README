Algorithm Analysis

Steps:
1. Created the main method
	A: Declared the 2D Array
	B: Declared the BitSet (NumMatch- 76)
	C: Call the fillCard method
	D: Call the printCard method
	E: Call the playGame method
2. The fillCard method: (public void)
	A: Inputs integers from the external file 
	B: Uses the 2D array 
3.The printCard method: (public void)
	A: Displays the word BINGO
	B: Creates the bingo card
	C: will also display an X if a number has been marked
4.Check for win method
	A: Checks for vertical, diagonal, and horizontal wins
	B: Returns 1,2, or 3 based on win type
5. Play Game method
	A: The game is ran from this method
6.Mark Card Method
	A: If a number on the card is picked, it is set to 0 and it will turn that 0 into an X in the print card method

7.Pick Random
	A: Returns a random number for the game
